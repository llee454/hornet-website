                <p>Welcome to the eOffer/eMod User Guide! This guide will introduce you to the eOffer/eMod system, a web-based application designed to make the contracting process efficient and secure. The system allows for seamless transmission of data from the Vendor/Contractor community to the Federal Acquisition (FAS) Contracting Offices. This guide is intended for vendors, but can be useful to Contracting Officers (COs) and Contracting Specialists (CSs) as well.</p>
                <p>This Guide was written to give an accessible understanding of the different functions of eOffer/eMod to vendors who use the system to submit contract Offers and Contract Modifications. The guide aims to give a comprehensive and easy-to-understand breakdown of the functions of eOffer/eMod, with helpful hints and important reminders along the way.</p>

              <p>Under the Schedules Program, Vendors can establish long-term Contracts with GSA that allow them to do business with customers throughout the federal government. In order for Vendors to become a "GSA Schedule Contractor," they must first submit an Offer in response to an applicable Multiple Award Schedule Solicitation. These solicitations are accessible at the Federal Business Opportunities website, (<a href="https://www.fbo.gov/" target="_blank">FBO.gov</a>), or, as of 2011, via a link on the eOffer/eMod home page.</p>
              <p>Launched in mid-2004, the eMod/eOffer system is a web-based interface allowing Vendors to electronically prepare and submit Contract Offers and Contract Modifications. At a high level, the system allows for an interactive, secure electronic environment that simplifies the Contracting process from Proposal preparation and submission through Contract Award and Closeout.</p>
              <p>The <a href="index.html#book_page_page/modules%2Fbook%2Fdatabase.xml/eoffer_emod/eoffer-resources/preparing-your-electronic-contract-offer-eoffer/preparing-your-electronic-contract-offer-eoffer-overview">eOffer module</a> is available for more than 30 schedules, for example, Furniture (Schedule 71), Office Products and Supplies (Schedule 75), Financial and Business Solutions (Schedule 520), and Professional Engineering Services (Schedule 871).</p>
              <p>The <a href="index.html#book_page_page/modules%2Fbook%2Fdatabase.xml/eoffer_emod/emod-resources/preparing-an-electronic-contract-modification-emod">eMod module</a> enables Contractors to prepare and submit Electronic Contract Modifications for all GSA MAS Contracts. Multiple eMods may be submitted within a single transaction, allowing for an expeditious process. </p>
              <p>The eOffer/eMod system is online at <a href="http://eoffer.gsa.gov" target="_blank">http://eoffer.gsa.gov</a>. Vendors can <a href="index.html#book_page_page/modules%2Fbook%2Fdatabase.xml/eoffer_emod/eoffer-resources/signature-process/signature-process-overview">eSign</a> any Contract Offers or Modifications, but must do so using their <a href="index.html#book_page_page/modules%2Fbook%2Fdatabase.xml/eoffer_emod/overview/accessing-eoffer-emod/digital-certificates/digital-certificates-overview">Digital Certificates</a>. </p>
              <p>The following five characteristics form the core benefits for a Vendor using the eOffer/eMod system:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>eSimple</strong>: User friendly screens lead through the submittal process. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>eSecure</strong>: Digital Certificates ensure the integrity of proprietary data. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>eSave</strong>: Electronic process reduces delivery costs and delays. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>eShare</strong>: Web-based technology facilitates collaboration on Proposal preparation. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>eSign</strong>: Electronic signatures allow offers and mods to be signed quickly and easily. </p>
                </li>

                  <p>eOffer/eMod is a publicly available system; it does not reside behind GSA's firewall. Therefore, eOffer/eMod is available to any internet user via the URL, <a href="http://eoffer.gsa.gov/" target="_blank">http://eoffer.gsa.gov/</a>. Having said that, most of the functionality discussed in this Guide involves signing into a secure portion of the website, and there are a few key requirements that need to be satisfied in order for a vendor to actually use the system once signed in.</p>

                            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> The information you enter while purchasing a Digital Certificate must match exactly the information that will be used within the eOffer/eMod system. The Certificate application should also be completed on the same workstation that will be used to accept the Certificate.</p>

                            <p><strong>Things to Remember:</strong> Your Digital Certificate must be an ACES Level 3 Certificate, (a "Business Identity Certificate"). Without this level of authentication, vendors will not be able to create a legally binding Contract. As noted in this topic, the industry partners who currently provide Level 3 Digital Authentication Certificates for the GSA vendor community are <a href="http://www.identrust.com/gsa/index.html" target="_blank">IdenTrust</a> and <a href="http://aces.orc.com" target="_blank">Operational Research Consultants (ORC)</a>.

                      <p>Digital Certificates are required by Contractor staff in order to access the eOffer/eMod system. Upon logging into the system, Digital Certificate information is validated against the Authorized Negotiators on a Contract.</p>
                      <p>To begin, click on the <strong>Sign In</strong> button under <strong>Contract Offers (eOffers)</strong> or <strong>Contract Modification (eMod)</strong>. When a user accesses either of the modules, there can be one of several outcomes:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p>The user's digital certificate is validated against the list of Authorized Negotiators on a Contract and the user is granted access.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>Either the user has never been listed as an Authorized Negotiator because the original Offer was submitted by Paper and thus the user was never added to the electronic system, or the old Negotiator has left the Company at which point they are trying to get a new Negotiator listed in the table.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>The user was in the Authorized Negotiator list and has either changed his or her name, or gotten a new Digital Certificate without listing his or her details as on the Authorized Negotiator list. Or the person who initially submitted the vendor's information entered it into the system differently than how it was listed on their Digital Certificate.</p>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>If the user's login attempt falls into either of the last two scenarios, the system will attempt to validate by using certain combinations of user details. If a potential match is found in the Contract's list of Authorized Negotiators, the user will be able to select his or her information from a list provided, and then submit that information to the existing Authorized Negotiators/Contract Administrators for approval. If the existing Authorized Negotiators/Contract Administrators do not take an action with seven days to approve the new addition, the request is then sent to the CO/CS for approval. The vendor's details are then transferred to the Authorized Negotiators/Contract Administrators, or to the CO/CS, for approval.</p>
                      <p>The validation combinations include:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>

                <body><![CDATA[
                  <p>The Central Contractor Registration (CCR)/Federal Agency Registration (FedReg), the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), and several other databases have been integrated into a single system to create a streamlined process for entities to register with the Federal Government, (formerly CCR/FedReg), and complete representations and Certifications (formerly ORCA). The System for Award Management, or SAM, is now the primary registrant database for the U.S. Federal Government. SAM collects, validates, and stores entity data in support of Agency Acquisition missions. A vendor must be registered with SAM prior to the Award of a Schedule Contract. Additionally, a DUNS number is required when registering with SAM.</p>

                <body><![CDATA[
                  <p>The web-based application eOffer allows Companies to electronically prepare and submit a Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Contract Proposal to GSA's Federal Acquisition Service. It creates an interactive and secure electronic environment that simplifies the Contracting process from submission of Proposals all the way through Contract Award.</p>
                  <p>In the past, a vendor's submission of a Contract Offer relied heavily on paper-based processes. Vendors would print a bunch of forms, compile their Offers, and mail them in to GSA. Email helped expedite the process somewhat, but GSA still lacked a centralized system capable of handing the entirety of the Offer process.</p>
                  <p>eOffer, introduced in May 2004, has become the preferred method by which Contract Offers are submitted to GSA. This system is available for use on most of GSA's Multiple Award Schedules (MAS). With a friendly user interface and advanced functionality, eOffer has become an important tool for GSA as well as the vendor community.</p>

                <body><![CDATA[
                  <p>The Offer process has several basic steps that must be completed outside of the system before you can use eOffer.</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>Download and read the Solicitation that you are making an Offer against, and complete the required documents for that Solicitation. The Solicitations available for eOffers have recently been published to the system directly. You can access all of the solicitation documents <a href="http://eoffer.gsa.gov/eOffer/util/solicitationUtilAction.do?method=view&amp;displaySolList=Y" target="_blank">here</a> or by searching for them on <a href="http://www.fbo.gov" target="_blank">FBO.gov</a>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Gather your Company information and create the required documents for the Solicitation before starting to complete the information in eOffer. Once this has been done, you can enter the eOffer Application (which requires a Digital Certificate for authentication), prepare the responses to the Offer and submit your Proposal.</p>

                  <p>All users who need to access the system to work on a particular eOffer will need to be added as Authorized Negotiators. Multiple Negotiators may be added at one time, if necessary. The Negotiator's name and email address <strong><u>must be entered exactly</u></strong> as they appear on the individual's Digital Certificate.</p>
                  <p>Note that it is important to have more than one Negotiator assigned to a Contract. In the event that one Negotiator is unavailable, you will have another assigned to the Contract to ensure that a representative from your Company can still sign off on agreements with the government.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, as of February 2012, all Negotiators on a Contract have been provided "Global Read Capabilities." This means that no matter who has started a Contract Offer or Modification Request, an Authorized Negotiator will have the ability to create, submit, and edit offers and modification requests.</p>

                    <li>

                        <p><strong>Helpful Hint:</strong> A Negotiator can be assigned one of two roles; one denotes the Negotiator is authorized to sign and one denotes the Negotiator is not authorized to sign. A Negotiator who is "Authorized to Sign" is capable of providing his or her Digital Certificate for the benefit of any Offers or Mods. In essence, this person has been granted the authority to bind the Company into agreements with GSA. Someone who is not authorized to sign, however, may prepare an Offer, but will not be allowed to sign or submit it. Note that there should be at least one Negotiator who is authorized to sign.</p>

However, with products like markers that are sold more than one in a package, the unit of issue would be "package" and the quantity per unit would be the number of markers in the package (i.e. 8).</p>

                  <p>There are five specific questions that you must respond to in this section, each of which relate to various acts, programs, or administrative issues relating to your GSA Schedule Contract Offering. Though there is some information available on screen, in the text below we identify some of the important elements of each of the questions to which you are required to respond.</p>
                  <h4>Disaster Recovery Purchasing Program</h4>
                  <p>Under the <strong>Disaster Recovery Purchasing Program</strong>, state and local government entities may purchase a variety of Products and Services from Contracts Awarded under GSA Federal Supply Schedules to facilitate recovery from a major disaster, terrorism, or nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack.</p>
                  <p>State and local government entities may use GSA Schedule Contracts to purchase Products and Services in advance of a major disaster declared by the president, as well as in the aftermath of an emergency event. State and local government entities are responsible for ensuring that the Products or Services purchased are to be used to facilitate recovery.</p>
                  <p>By selecting <strong>Yes</strong> to participation in the Disaster Recovery Purchasing Program, your Company becomes eligible to provide Products or Services in the event of a disaster.</p>
                  <h4>Exceptions to Terms and Conditions</h4>
                  <p>The "Exceptions To Terms and Conditions" question asks whether or not you agree to all the standard terms and conditions described in the Solicitation package. While reading through the Solicitation documents, you should have noted whether there was anything you did not agree with. If you found a particular clause or term that was not to your liking, you should open a new document, identify the term, and provide your rationale as to why you are taking an exception to the term.</p>
                  <h4>Exceptions to ORCA Certs and Reps</h4>
                  <p>The "Orca Certs and Reps" question confirms that your information in ORCA is up to date. If there have been any changes to your Company information (such as a change in company size, NAICS, etc.), you should answer '<strong>No</strong>' and provide information to GSA as to why you have done so.</p>
                  <h4>Participation in ARRA</h4>
                  <p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided GSA with several billion dollars for investments in Federal buildings, procurement of more energy-efficient motor vehicles, and additional funding for the GSA Inspector General to provide oversight to the GSA Programs and Projects funded by the Recovery Act. With its implementation, new clauses have been added to the Contract. You must choose whether or not you agree to these clauses.</p>
                  <h4>Participation in E-Verify</h4>
                  <p>The <strong>Employment Eligibility Verification</strong> or "E-Verify" is an Internet-based system that allows an employer-using information reported on an employee's Form I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification)-to determine the eligibility of that employee to work in the United States. This new system allows you to certify online whether or not all of your employees are eligible to work in the U.S.</p>

                            <p>A markup is based on the markup over cost (e.g. a 5% markup over the manufacturer's catalog price). This is common for dealer/resellers. Imagine your company is a dealer/reseller of widgets. The manufacturer catalog price that you pay for the widgets is $10 per widget. The price you are offering GSA is a 5% markup on the price you pay the manufacturer, or $10.50.</p>

                          <li>
                            <p>A build-out is derived from a buildup of individual costs. Your proposed GSA price is derived by totaling the individual cost elements that it takes to produce your product or service, and then adding an amount for profit. Profit, or fee, is usually expressed as a percentage of the cost elements. Your GSA proposed price will typically be a reduced profit or fee applied to the cost elements (e.g. labor + general &amp; administrative + overhead + 5% profit = proposed GSA labor rate).</p>

                            <p><strong>Helpful Hint:</strong> When selecting facsimile transmission, you do not need to enter the contact information in the area below. Alternatively, to receive Orders via fax, you can elect to establish an electronic means for receipt of Orders by selecting the <strong>Computer to Computer Electronic Data Interchange</strong> option. In order to receive Orders via EDI, you will need to set up an interface with the government.</p>
                            <p>In addition, you do not need to set up the interface prior to Contract Award, but you do need to provide the contact information for the person who will be responsible for setting up the EDI with the government. This person will be contacted by GSA after Contract Award to establish the interface.</p>

                  <p>A Subcontracting Plan is required on a Contract under certain situations. Generally, the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) require a Subcontracting Plan from a Contractor classified as "Other than Small Business," when the actual Sales of a Contract exceed the $650,000 threshold or $1,500,000 for construction.</p>

            <body><![CDATA[
              <p>eMod is a web-based application that allows vendors to submit their Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) contract modification requests electronically (eMods). eMod uses the digital authentication technology in order to ensure the integrity of data, and provides electronic signature capability. A digital certificate is required in order to use eMod. See the section on <a href="index.html#book_page_page/modules%2Fbook%2Fdatabase.xml/eoffer_emod/overview/accessing-eoffer-emod/digital-certificates/digital-certificates-overview">Digital Certificates</a> for more details. </p>
              <p>Using eMod, a vendor can submit multiple mods within a single transaction. Different type(s) of mods and their associated subtypes can be selected. Another feature of eMod allows GSA contracting personnel to "split" mods. For example, a Contracting Officer (CO) has the ability to perform a split if one of the mods can be done quickly, but the other mod action may require more time to complete.</p>
              <p>Rather than waiting for both mods to be completed at the same time, splitting the mod expedites the process.</p>

                <div class="conceptBoxText">
                  <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> While the following discussion outlines the process of a vendor- submitted contract modification, a GSA Contract Officer (CO) or Contract Specialist (CS) is able to issue unilateral mods that do not require vendor confirmation. </p>

              <p>Creating an eMod is the bread and butter of the eMod system. In the following steps, we will show you how to navigate the system to modify your existing MAS contract. In fact, we will show you how to submit a mod for each of the modification Primary Types and Subtypes.</p>
              <p>From the "My Modifications" home page, you can see all of the saved, submitted, and signed modifications. You can create a new eMod (as described below) or edit an existing one. Note that if you are opting to edit an existing modification, a new "Lock" functionality has been introduced that may not allow you to work on a submission. If a modification has been locked, there will be a "closed lock" icon next to it. If a user wishes to edit a submitted modification, they can request to unlock the mod by clicking the "Edit Mod" button. If the mod is already unlocked, a user can edit the modification just by clicking the "Edit Mod" button.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Click the drop-down box under <strong>New Modifications</strong>, select the appropriate contract number, and click the <strong>Select Contract</strong> button. </p>

                    <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> It is important to note that eMod will not allow you to submit multiple modification requests for the same type of mod action. For example, if you have already submitted a modification for a Website Address Change, the system will prompt you to view the existing mod rather than allow you to create a new one. </p>

Upon accessing the eMod system, the vendor will be notified of the name/address change via a pop-up message.

                      <p>Federal agencies often set aside contracts for small businesses with revenues under a specified threshold. As part of the contract offer process, your company was required to certify that it was or was not a small business. The Re-Representation of Business Size modification allows you to inform GSA if your company outgrows its small business designation, meaning it exceeds the revenue threshold that allows it to be categorized as a small business; or, inform GSA if your company size decreases and it now qualifies as a small business.</p>
                      <p>Businesses often fluctuate in size and, at times, may grow above the small business size standard or shrink below the threshold. In these such instances, you will need to modify your contract to re-represent your business size.</p>

                      <p>A Subcontracting Plan is required on a contract under certain situations. Generally, the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) require a subcontracting plan from a Contractor classified as "Other than Small Business" when the actual sales of a contract exceed the $650,000 threshold (for contracts awarded on or after October 1, 2010) or the $550,000 threshold (for contracts awarded prior to October 1, 2010). In such a case, an informational message will appear on the <em>My Modifications</em> page as shown below.</p>

            <body><![CDATA[
              <p>When you submitted your initial offer, you were asked to perform some projections as to how much business you had planned to do with the government. One of the solicitation documents that you were required to upload included the CSP-1.</p>
              <p>You will notice that on some mods there is a section for <strong>Updating or Revise Commerical Sales Practice (CSP-1)</strong>. Beginning, in August of 2013, all contract modifications that could potentially impact the CSP for your contract will include the ability to revise the existing CSP-1 that is associated with your contract. These primary mod types include the following: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Additions;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Deletions; and</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Pricing.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The purpose of this section is to assist you in completing the electronic CSP-1 form.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>You will be alerted that exercising your current modification may require you to update your commercial sales practices (CSPs). If this is the case, answer <strong>Yes</strong> and click <strong>Save</strong>, and you will be taken to the CSP update or revise your CSPs. Note that the phrasing of this question will reflect the mod you are exercising and may look different from the screenshot. </p>

                      <p><strong>Helpful Hint:</strong> As of August 2013, certain mod types will require the submitter to upload CSP documentation. In addition, these mods will also include an optional electronic form that users may use to update the CSP information. </p>

If you answer <strong>Yes</strong>, include the following: discussion on any situations that lead to deviations from standard practice, an explanation of how often they occur, and the controls you employ to assure the integrity of your pricing. Examples of typical deviations may include, but are not limited to: one time goodwill discounts to charity organizations or to compensate an otherwise disgruntled customer; a limited sale of obsolete or damaged goods; the sale of sample goods to a new customer; or the sales of prototype goods for testing purposes. </p>
                  <p>If deviations from your written policies or standard commercial sales practices disclosed in the chart on the Commercial Sales Practices Format are so significant and/or frequent that the Contracting Officer cannot establish whether the price(s) offered is fair and reasonable, then you may be asked to provide additional information. The Contracting Officer may ask for information to demonstrate that you have made substantial sales of the item(s) in the commercial market consistent with the information reflected on the chart on the Commercial Sales Practice Format, a description of the conditions surrounding those sales deviations, or other information that may be necessary in order for the Contracting Officer to determine whether your offered price(s) is fair and reasonable. In cases where additional information is requested, the Contracting Officer will target the request in order to limit the submission of data to that needed to establish the reasonableness of the offered price.</p>

                  <p>The screen will update whether you have chosen to specify your discount/concession policy at the Offer/Contract level or at the SIN level.</p>
                  <p>If you chose the Offer/Contract level you can specify your discount in terms of a discount or a markup/build out.</p>

                  <p>A discount is, plainly, a discount from the original price.</p>
                  <p>A mark up is based on the markup over cost (e.g. a 5% markup over the manufacturer's catalog price). This is common for dealer/resellers. Imagine your company is a dealer/reseller of widgets. The manufacturer catalog price that you pay for the widgets is $10 per widget. The price you are offering GSA is a 5% markup on the price you pay the manufacturer or $10.50.</p>
                  <p>A buildup is derived from a buildup of individual costs. Your proposed GSA price is derived by totaling the individual cost elements that it takes to produce your product or service, and then adding an amount for profit. Profit, or fee, is usually expressed as a percentage of the cost elements. Your GSA proposed price will typically be a reduced profit or fee applied to the cost elements (e.g. labor + general &amp; administrative + overhead + 5% profit = proposed GSA labor rate).</p>

                  <p>The Contracting Officer assigned to a particular offer has the ability to "split" the original mod into two. The purpose is to separate modification(s) which can be processed in a shorter time versus modification(s) which may take longer.</p>

            Before you make your selection for a pricing template, you must have completed each section on your left-hand navigational menu. When you are ready to enter your pricing data, you have three templates from which to choose. The method you select is dependent upon the number of items you need to enter, and your preference to work on or offline.

          <p>
            On this screen, you will see three options: Download/Upload Template, On-Screen Data Entry, and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).
