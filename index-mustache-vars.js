      "endorsement-quote": "I was Larry's supervisor at SiFive. There, he was instrumental in bringing up a formal specification of the RISC-V processor in Kami, which is a framework in Coq to specify hardware circuits using transactional semantics. The task was pretty complex, given the enormity of the RISC-V specification and the ability to understand, Kami, a new framework completely, in order to write programs in that framework. Larry was a quick learner and was highly motivated to perform this task. <b>He paid a lot of attention to detail and had excellent software engineering skills</b> - always coming up with unit test cases even for the smallest change made or feature added to the code base. Overall, I enjoyed working with Larry.",
